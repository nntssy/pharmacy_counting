# pharmacy-counting
My solution to the [Insight Data Engineering Coding Competition](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/pharmacy_counting).

## Executing the project
The solution is written in Python 2.
The script `run.sh` executes the project; the input data file is `input/itcont.txt`, and the result is written into `output/top_cost_drug.txt`. Running `insight_testsuite/run_tests.sh` evaluates the solution using the tests from `insight_testsuite/tests/`.

_**Note:**_ *to execute `run_tests.sh`, change your current_working_directory to `insight_testsuite/` first, and then call `./run_tests.sh`.*

## Algorithm overview
The algorithm reads data entries from the input file `itcont.txt` line by line, extracting required fields from each line after it is read, and adding the new data to the data structures that allow efficient computation of the required statistics.

_The memory requirement of the algorithm is **O(N)**. In the worst case **N** is the total number of entries scanned so far, and all of them will need to be stored to guarantee precise calculation of the *n*-th percentile._

The data structure used to store the drugs information is a dictionary `drugs`, that has drug names as keys and pairs (lists) `[total_cost,id_set]` as values. `total_cost` is the total cost of all prescriptions of particular drug and is updated as more and more data entries are processed. `id_set` is a set of all `id`-fields of people that prescribed this particular drug. Since it is needed to count all _unique_ prescribers for each drug name, it is checked frequently whether the current provider already prescribed it. `set()` data structure is used because, compared to list, it allows a faster check whether element is a part of the iterable or not.

## Assumptions
* input is not extremely large so that all the processed data may be stored in the RAM;
* `id` is a row of symbols (without `,`);
* each prescriber has their unique id, so when checking uniqueness, we can just refer to the `id` field and ignore the name of prescriber;
* `drug_name` can contain `,` and when it does, it also has `"` in the beginning and the end;
* `drug_cost` is a real (float) number (the input numbers can be integers, but they will be converted to floats).

## Project dependencies
My implementation only imports variables from standard Python library `sys`.

## Other
The test proposed in the assignment was modified to fit into the format of the proposed large dataset in a way that:
* all data entries (for input and output) start from new lines;
* the cost values in the output are converted to floats.
